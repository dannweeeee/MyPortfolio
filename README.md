## Built and Deployed my own website portfolio
I used the following:
**ThreeJS** - A powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
**React Three Fiber** - A popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
**TailwindCSS** - A popular utility-first CSS styling framework
**Framer Motion** - The most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations
**EmailJS** - Implement sending emails through a form on the website

I also ensured responsiveness across all devices and improve your site's performance using **Suspense** and **Preload**.
